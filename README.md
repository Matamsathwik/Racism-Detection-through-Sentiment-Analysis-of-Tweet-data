## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting racism-related sentiment in tweet data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. By analyzing tweet text, the model can classify content as **racist, non-racist, or neutral**, aiding in social media moderation and anti-discrimination efforts.

## 🎯 Objective

- To build a sentiment classifier that identifies racist content in tweets.
- To clean and preprocess tweet data using NLP techniques.
- To apply machine learning models for text classification and evaluate their performance.

## 📂 Dataset

- Twitter dataset containing labeled racist and non-racist tweets.
- Preprocessed to remove noise like URLs, mentions, emojis, and stopwords.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **NLTK**, **re**, **string** – Text preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**
